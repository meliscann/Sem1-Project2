# Sem1-Project2

This **C**code was written as part of my learning process during my first year of university. It includes various operations on binary numbers such as converting decimal to binary, binary to decimal, binary addition, and performing basic arithmetic operations based on user input. The goal was to practice fundamental programming concepts like arrays, loops, and conditionals while working with binary representations and basic arithmetic.

**Here's a simple breakdown:**

**Decimal to Binary:** Converts a decimal number (between -127 and 128) into an 8-bit binary number.
**Binary to Decimal:** Converts an 8-bit binary number back into its decimal equivalent.
**Binary Addition:** Adds two 8-bit binary numbers together and shows the result.
**Basic Math Operations:** Allows the user to choose between addition, multiplication, or division, and performs the selected operation on two numbers.
